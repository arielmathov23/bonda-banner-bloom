# Flux API Production Fix

## Problem Summary

The Flux API was not working in production despite the API key being correctly set in Vercel environment variables. The issue was working in local development but failing in production with "API key not saved" errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Direct API Calls in Production**: The original implementation made direct API calls to `https://api.bfl.ai/v1` from the browser in production, which can cause CORS issues.

2. **Environment Variable Access**: While the `VITE_FLUX_API_KEY` was set in Vercel, there were potential issues with how it was being accessed in the production build.

3. **Missing Backend Proxy**: The development proxy configured in `vite.config.ts` wasn't available in production, causing the API calls to fail.

4. **Limited Error Handling**: Error messages weren't providing enough information to debug production deployment issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Universal API Proxy (`/api/flux/[...slug].ts`)

Created a Vercel serverless function that acts as a proxy for all Flux API calls:

- **Location**: `api/flux/[...slug].ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles all Flux API endpoints through a single proxy
- **Benefits**: 
  - Keeps API key secure on the server side
  - Eliminates CORS issues
  - Works in both development and production
  - Provides consistent error handling

### 2. Simplified FluxAPIClient Configuration

Updated the `FluxAPIClient` class to always use the proxy:

- **Before**: Switched between `/api/flux` (dev) and `https://api.bfl.ai/v1` (prod)
- **After**: Always uses `/api/flux` for both environments
- **File**: `src/lib/flux.ts`

### 3. Enhanced Environment Variable Handling

Added comprehensive debugging and validation:

- **Configuration Testing**: New `testFluxConfiguration()` function
- **Detailed Logging**: Enhanced debugging information in production
- **Status Checking**: Improved `isFluxConfigured()` and `getFluxAPIKeyStatus()` functions

### 4. Production-Specific Error Handling

Updated error messages to provide actionable troubleshooting steps:

- **Network Issues**: Clear guidance for connection problems
- **API Key Errors**: Specific instructions for Vercel environment variables
- **Quota Issues**: Direct links to account management
- **Server Errors**: Helpful context for temporary issues

## Files Modified

1. **`api/flux.ts`** - Main proxy handler
2. **`api/flux/[...slug].ts`** - Dynamic route handler for all endpoints
3. **`src/lib/flux.ts`** - Updated client configuration and error handling
4. **`src/lib/enhanced-banner-service.ts`** - Enhanced availability checking

## Environment Variables Required

In your Vercel dashboard, ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
VITE_FLUX_API_KEY=your_actual_flux_api_key_here
# OR alternatively:
FLUX_API_KEY=your_actual_flux_api_key_here
```

The proxy will check both `VITE_FLUX_API_KEY` and `FLUX_API_KEY` for maximum compatibility.

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
- The proxy should work through the existing Vite dev server configuration

### 2. Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```
- The serverless functions will handle the API proxying

### 3. Debugging Tools

You can now use these functions to test the configuration:

```javascript
import { testFluxConfiguration, getFluxAPIKeyStatus } from './lib/flux';

// Test configuration
const configTest = await testFluxConfiguration();
console.log(configTest);

// Get API key status
const status = getFluxAPIKeyStatus();
console.log(status);
```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Working Correctly
- Flux API calls work in both development and production
- API key is kept secure on the server side
- Clear error messages for any configuration issues
- Detailed logging for debugging

### ❌ If Issues Persist
1. Check Vercel environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify the API key is valid and has proper permissions
3. Check Vercel function logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure the API proxy functions are deployed correctly

## Security Improvements

- **API Key Protection**: API key is now only accessible server-side
- **CORS Handling**: Proper CORS headers set by the proxy
- **Error Sanitization**: Production errors don't expose sensitive information

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: The proxy can be extended to cache responses if needed
- **Rate Limiting**: Can be added to the proxy for additional protection
- **Monitoring**: Vercel function logs provide visibility into API usage

## Future Enhancements

1. **Response Caching**: Cache generated images to reduce API calls
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting in the proxy
3. **Error Analytics**: Add error tracking for production issues
4. **Health Checks**: Regular API health monitoring

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "API key not configured" in production
**Solution**: Check Vercel environment variables are set correctly

### Problem: Network timeouts in production
**Solution**: Check Vercel function logs for detailed error messages

### Problem: CORS errors
**Solution**: The proxy should eliminate CORS issues - check if it's deployed correctly

### Problem: API quota exceeded
**Solution**: Check your Flux API account billing and limits

## Support

If you encounter issues with this fix:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Review Vercel function logs for server-side errors
3. Use the `testFluxConfiguration()` function for diagnostics
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly in Vercel dashboard

The fix provides comprehensive error handling and debugging tools to help identify and resolve any remaining issues quickly.
